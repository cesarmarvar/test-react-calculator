# Password component with state

Using react `useState` hook, create the following component

![Password component](https://p-vvf5mjm.t4.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/NQuNO81d/d1f72d4f-c485-4eb6-87bf-312cc19d146c.gif?source=viewer&v=b07aaa7255a1391c6e79d0367916fc6b)

The input should change between `type="text"` and `type="password"` based on the
`show` state (true or false)

## Controlled password

Make sure that the input value is controlled by React. What could you do to make
sure that the password value could never have whitespaces?
