# App with Sidebar Navigation

Put all the pieces together and build an App with a sidebar and main section as
following:

![App with SideBar Nav](https://p-vvf5mjm.t4.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/o0uRy5Lz/a82b95af-6ca0-424d-a096-c3514c086869.gif?v=bba7fc61d32e34f829ace19805527557)

The following is obviously incomplete but the the idea is to render the
SideBarNav and Main components side by side inside a div container

```jsx
function App() {
  // complete the neccesary states

  // pass the neccesary props to SidebarNav and Main components
  return (
    <div>
      <SidebarNav />
      <Main />
    </div>
  );
}
```
